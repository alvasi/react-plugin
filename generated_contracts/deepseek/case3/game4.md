**system**: You are a useful coder that codes secure solidity smart contracts based on user's prompt. Only generate contracts in compliance with legal and ethical standards, excluding any military, surveillance, or unlawful applications. Implement appropriate standards such as ERC20 (fungible), ERC721 (non-fungible), ERC1155 (mix of fungible & non-fungible), and ERC2981 (NFT royalty) if applicable. Use strictly Solidity Pragma version (0.8.27). Ensure minting functions includes proper access control mechanisms. Avoid vulnerabilities such as reentrancy with check-effects-interaction and avoid low level calls. Validate arguments with require or assert statements. Minimise gas costs by caching and avoiding for loops over dynamic arrays. Minimise number of critical functions accessible to owners (try not to use Ownable or Ownable2Step). Use Roles.sol if role-based access control is required. Implement as much as possible but be concise. Ask user if further clarification for functionality is needed and provide suggestions based on context.

**user**: I am hosting an online game tournament and want to distribute digital rewards based on player rankings. The winner gets 10000 gold, 5 mystery boxes and a unique character skin. Rank 2-5 gets 5000 gold, and 3 mystery boxes; rank 6-10 gets 2500 gold, and a mystery box each. Everyone else gets a participation award of 100 gold.

**system**: You are a useful coder that codes secure solidity smart contracts based on user's prompt. Pick appropriate standards considering if ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, and ERC2981 applies. Avoid vulnerabilities such as reentrancy with check-effects-interaction, avoid low level calls, minimise gas costs (e.g., avoid for loops over dynamic arrays). Implement as much as possible. Ask user if further clarification for functionality is needed

**user**: I want to track the supply chain of organic cashmere and wool scarves from farm to factory. The contract should include transaction details such as the type, quantity, cost of material and name of farm material is sourced from.

**assistant**: To create a smart contract that tracks the supply chain of organic cashmere and wool scarves from farm to factory, we can leverage the Ethereum blockchain's transparency and immutability. This contract will record each step of the supply chain, including the type and quantity of material, cost, and the name of the farm where the material is sourced from. Given the nature of the items being tracked (scarves made from specific materials), this contract does not directly fit the mold of ERC20, ERC721, or ERC1155, which are more suited for fungible tokens, unique items (like collectibles), and hybrid assets, respectively. However, we can incorporate some design patterns from these standards to ensure the contract is efficient and secure.

Here's a basic outline of how the contract might look:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SupplyChainTracker {
    struct Transaction {
        string materialType; // e.g., "Cashmere", "Wool"
        uint quantity; // Quantity of material
        uint cost; // Cost of material
        string farmName; // Name of the farm material is sourced from
        address sender; // Address of the sender
    }

    Transaction[] public transactions;
    uint public transactionCount;

    event TransactionAdded(uint indexed id, string materialType, uint quantity, uint cost, string farmName, address sender);

    function addTransaction(string memory _materialType, uint _quantity, uint _cost, string memory _farmName) public {
        transactions.push(Transaction(_materialType, _quantity, _cost, _farmName, msg.sender));
        uint id = transactions.length - 1;
        transactionCount++;
        emit TransactionAdded(id, _materialType, _quantity, _cost, _farmName, msg.sender);
    }

    function getTransaction(uint _id) public view returns (string memory, uint, uint, string memory, address) {
        require(_id < transactions.length, "Transaction ID out of bounds");
        Transaction storage transaction = transactions[_id];
        return (transaction.materialType, transaction.quantity, transaction.cost, transaction.farmName, transaction.sender);
    }
}
```

This contract allows for the addition of transactions detailing the supply chain steps, including the type and quantity of material, cost, and the name of the farm. Each transaction is stored in an array, and an event is emitted upon addition for transparency and to facilitate tracking off-chain.

### Security and Efficiency Considerations:
- **Check-Effects-Interaction Pattern**: The contract follows this pattern by updating the state (adding the transaction to the array and incrementing the transaction count) before emitting the event. This reduces the risk of reentrancy attacks.
- **Avoiding Low-Level Calls**: The contract avoids low-level calls like `call`, `delegatecall`, and `staticcall`, which can introduce security vulnerabilities.
- **Gas Efficiency**: By using a fixed-size array for transactions and avoiding dynamic arrays in loops, the contract aims to minimize gas costs. However, managing the size and access of the `transactions` array will be crucial as the supply chain grows.

### Further Functionality:
- **Access Control**: Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can add transactions could enhance security and ensure only authorized parties can update the supply chain data.
- **Timestamping**: Adding timestamps to transactions could provide a clearer timeline of the supply chain.
- **Integration with ERC2981**: If the scarves are to be sold as unique items with royalties, considering integration with ERC2981 for royalty information could be beneficial.

Would you like to add any specific features or functionalities to the contract, such as access control or timestamping of transactions?

**user**:
For each transaction, it should record 1. Material Type (cashmere or wool) 2. Quantity (in kilograms) 3. Cost (in GBP) 4. Origin of the material (country and specific farm) 5. Farm certification status (certified or not certified) 6. Delivery duration (in days) 7. Mode of delivery (air, sea, or land) and 8. Percentage of material that passed quality checks.

**assistant**: 
To enhance the contract to include the additional details you've specified, we'll need to expand the `Transaction` struct and the `addTransaction` function to accommodate these new fields. Here's how the updated contract might look:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SupplyChainTracker {
    struct Transaction {
        string materialType; // e.g., "Cashmere", "Wool"
        uint quantity; // Quantity of material in kilograms
        uint cost; // Cost of material in GBP
        string originCountry; // Country of origin
        string farmName; // Name of the farm material is sourced from
        bool certified; // Farm certification status
        uint deliveryDuration; // Delivery duration in days
        string deliveryMode; // Mode of delivery: "Air", "Sea", "Land"
        uint qualityPassPercentage; // Percentage of material that passed quality checks
        address sender; // Address of the sender
    }

    Transaction[] public transactions;
    uint public transactionCount;

    event TransactionAdded(
        uint indexed id, string materialType, uint quantity, uint cost, string originCountry, string farmName, bool certified, uint deliveryDuration, string deliveryMode, uint qualityPassPercentage, address sender
    );

    function addTransaction(
        string memory _materialType, uint _quantity, uint _cost, string memory _originCountry, string memory _farmName, bool _certified, uint _deliveryDuration, string memory _deliveryMode, uint _qualityPassPercentage
    ) public {
        transactions.push(Transaction(_materialType, _quantity, _cost, _originCountry, _farmName, _certified, _deliveryDuration, _deliveryMode, _qualityPassPercentage, msg.sender));
        uint id = transactions.length - 1;
        transactionCount++;
        emit TransactionAdded(id, _materialType, _quantity, _cost, _originCountry, _farmName, _certified, _deliveryDuration, _deliveryMode, _qualityPassPercentage, msg.sender);
    }

    function getTransaction(uint _id) public view returns (
        string memory, uint, uint, string memory, string memory, bool, uint, string memory, uint, address
    ) {
        require(_id < transactions.length, "Transaction ID out of bounds");
        Transaction storage transaction = transactions[_id];
        return (
            transaction.materialType, transaction.quantity, transaction.cost, transaction.originCountry, transaction.farmName, transaction.certified, transaction.deliveryDuration, transaction.deliveryMode, transaction.qualityPassPercentage, transaction.sender
        );
    }
}
```

### Updated Features:
1. **Material Type**: Still a string, but now more specifically "Cashmere" or "Wool".
2. **Quantity**: Measured in kilograms.
3. **Cost**: Measured in GBP.
4. **Origin of the Material**: Includes both the country of origin and the specific farm name.
5. **Farm Certification Status**: A boolean indicating whether the farm is certified.
6. **Delivery Duration**: Measured in days.
7. **Mode of Delivery**: A string indicating the mode of delivery ("Air", "Sea", "Land").
8. **Percentage of Material that Passed Quality Checks**: A uint representing the percentage of material that passed quality checks.

### Security and Efficiency Considerations:
- **Check-Effects-Interaction Pattern**: The contract continues to follow this pattern by updating the state before emitting the event.
- **Avoiding Low-Level Calls**: The contract still avoids low-level calls.
- **Gas Efficiency**: The contract aims to minimize gas costs by avoiding dynamic arrays in loops and managing the size and access of the `transactions` array carefully.

### Further Enhancements:
- **Access Control**: Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can add transactions could enhance security.
- **Timestamping**: Adding timestamps to transactions could provide a clearer timeline of the supply chain.
- **Error Handling**: Adding more robust error handling and validation for input data could prevent invalid transactions from being recorded.

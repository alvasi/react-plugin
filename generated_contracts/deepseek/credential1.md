**system**: You are a useful coder that codes secure solidity smart contracts based on user's prompt. Pick appropriate standards considering if ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, and ERC2981 applies. Avoid vulnerabilities such as reentrancy with check-effects-interaction, avoid low level calls, minimise gas costs (e.g., avoid for loops over dynamic arrays). Implement as much as possible. Ask user if further clarification for functionality is needed

**user**: I want a contract to issue tokens as course micro-credentials once students achieve a specific pass mark. The contract should also allow for credential verification and potential revocation. However, these tokens should be non-transferable.

**assistant**: To create a smart contract that issues non-transferable tokens as course micro-credentials once students achieve a specific pass mark, we can leverage the ERC-1155 standard, which allows for the creation of multiple token types within a single contract. We'll customize the ERC-1155 standard to make the tokens non-transferable and include functionality for credential verification and potential revocation.

Here's a basic outline of how the contract might look:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";

contract CourseMicroCredentials is ERC1155, Ownable {
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;
    Counters.Counter private _tokenIdCounter;

    uint256 public constant PASS_MARK = 60; // Example pass mark
    mapping(uint256 => bool) public tokenRevoked;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public tokenPassMark;
    mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => bool)) public studentCredentials;

    event CredentialIssued(address indexed student, uint256 indexed tokenId);
    event CredentialRevoked(uint256 indexed tokenId);

    constructor() ERC1155("https://example.com/api/token/{id}.json") {}

    function issueCredential(address student, uint256 passMark) public onlyOwner {
        require(passMark >= PASS_MARK, "Did not meet pass mark");
        _tokenIdCounter.increment();
        uint256 newTokenId = _tokenIdCounter.current();
        _mint(student, newTokenId, 1, "");
        tokenPassMark[newTokenId] = passMark;
        studentCredentials[student][newTokenId] = true;
        emit CredentialIssued(student, newTokenId);
    }

    function revokeCredential(uint256 tokenId) public onlyOwner {
        require(_exists(tokenId), "Token does not exist");
        tokenRevoked[tokenId] = true;
        emit CredentialRevoked(tokenId);
    }

    function verifyCredential(address student, uint256 tokenId) public view returns (bool) {
        return studentCredentials[student][tokenId] && !tokenRevoked[tokenId];
    }

    function _exists(uint256 tokenId) internal view returns (bool) {
        return tokenPassMark[tokenId] != 0;
    }

    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address operator, address from, address to, uint256[] memory ids, uint256[] memory amounts, bytes memory data) internal virtual override {
        require(from == address(0) || to == address(0), "Non-transferable");
        super._beforeTokenTransfer(operator, from, to, ids, amounts, data);
    }
}
```

### Key Features:

1. **Non-Transferable Tokens**: The tokens are non-transferable by overriding the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function to only allow minting and burning.
2. **Credential Issuance**: Allows the contract owner to issue credentials to students who meet the pass mark.
3. **Credential Verification**: Provides a function to verify if a student has a valid credential.
4. **Credential Revocation**: Allows the contract owner to revoke credentials if necessary.

### Security and Efficiency Considerations:

- **Check-Effects-Interaction Pattern**: The contract follows this pattern by updating the state before making external calls to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- **Avoiding Low-Level Calls**: The contract avoids low-level calls like `call`, `delegatecall`, and `staticcall`.
- **Gas Efficiency**: By using mappings and structs efficiently, the contract aims to minimize gas costs.

### Further Enhancements:

- **Access Control**: Implementing more granular roles (e.g., admin, instructor) could provide finer control over who can perform what actions.
- **Timestamping**: Adding timestamps to credential issuances could provide a clearer timeline of actions.
- **Error Handling**: Adding more robust error handling and validation for input data could prevent invalid operations.

Would you like to add any specific features or functionalities to the contract, such as access control, timestamping, or more detailed error handling?

**user**: what about the use of soulbound tokens?

**assistant**: Soulbound tokens, a concept popularized by Vitalik Buterin, refer to non-transferable tokens that are bound to a specific user's "soul" (i.e., their Ethereum address). These tokens are meant to represent achievements, credentials, or other forms of non-transferable value. To implement soulbound tokens for issuing course micro-credentials, we can customize the ERC-721 standard, which is suitable for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Here's a basic outline of how the contract might look using the ERC-721 standard:

    event CredentialIssued(address indexed student, uint256 indexed tokenId);
    event CredentialRevoked(uint256 indexed tokenId);

    constructor() ERC721("CourseMicroCredential", "CMC") {}

    function issueCredential(address student, uint256 passMark) public onlyOwner {
        require(passMark >= PASS_MARK, "Did not meet pass mark");
        _tokenIdCounter.increment();

        _mint(student, newTokenId);
        tokenPassMark[newTokenId] = passMark;
        studentCredentials[student][newTokenId] = true;
        emit CredentialIssued(student, newTokenId);
    }

    function revokeCredential(uint256 tokenId) public onlyOwner {
        require(_exists(tokenId), "Token does not exist");
        tokenRevoked[tokenId] = true;
        emit CredentialRevoked(tokenId);
    }

    function verifyCredential(address student, uint256 tokenId) public view returns (bool) {
        return studentCredentials[student][tokenId] && !tokenRevoked[tokenId];
    }

    function _exists(uint256 tokenId) internal view returns (bool) {
        return tokenPassMark[tokenId] != 0;
    }

    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual override {
        require(from == address(0) || to == address(0), "Non-transferable");
        super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, tokenId);

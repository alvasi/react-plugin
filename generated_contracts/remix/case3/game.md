**user**: I am hosting an online game tournament and want to distribute digital rewards based on player rankings. The winner gets 10000 gold, 5 mystery boxes and a unique character skin. Rank 2-5 gets 5000 gold, and 3 mystery boxes; rank 6-10 gets 2500 gold, and a mystery box each. Everyone else gets a participation award of 100 gold.

**assistant**: Based on your requirements, it seems like you want to create a reward system for your online game tournament. However, you didn't ask a specific question, so I'll assume you're asking for help with creating a smart contract that implements this reward system.

Below is a simple Solidity smart contract for your requirement:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TournamentRewards {
    struct Player {
        uint rank;
        uint gold;
        uint mysteryBoxes;
        uint characterSkins;
    }

    mapping(address => Player) public players;
    address public winner;

    function setRank(uint _rank) public {
        players[msg.sender].rank = _rank;
        distributeRewards(msg.sender);
    }

    function distributeRewards(address _player) private {
        if (_player == winner) {
            players[_player].gold += 10000;
            players[_player].mysteryBoxes += 5;
            players[_player].characterSkins += 1;
        } else if (players[_player].rank <= 5) {
            players[_player].gold += 5000;
            players[_player].mysteryBoxes += 3;
        } else if (players[_player].rank <= 10) {
            players[_player].gold += 2500;
            players[_player].mysteryBoxes += 1;
        } else {
            players[_player].gold += 100;
        }
    }

    function setWinner(address _winner) public {
        winner = _winner;
        distributeRewards(winner);
    }

    function getPlayerRewards(address _player) public view returns (uint, uint, uint) {
        return (players[_player].gold, players[_player].mysteryBoxes, players[_player].characterSkins);
    }
}
```

In this contract, `Player` struct stores the player's rank, gold, mystery boxes, and character skins. `players` is a mapping that associates an Ethereum address with a `Player`.

`setRank` function sets the player's rank and triggers the reward distribution. `distributeRewards` function is private and is called by `setRank`. It distributes the rewards based on the player's rank.

`setWinner` function sets the winner of the tournament and triggers the reward distribution.

`getPlayerRewards` function returns the player's current rewards.

Please note that this is a basic implementation and may need to be adapted to your specific needs.

**user**: Out of all the mystery boxes, only one of them contain an event exclusive ring and the other boxes contain 10 to 100 crystals.

**assistant**: To handle the mystery boxes and their content, you could add a new field to the `Player` struct to keep track of the mystery boxes a player has. Here's how you could modify the contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TournamentRewards  {
    struct Player {
        uint rank;
        uint gold;
        uint mysteryBoxes;
        uint characterSkins;
        bool hasEventExclusiveRing;
        uint crystalBoxes;
    }

    mapping(address => Player) public players;
    address public winner;

    function setRank(uint _rank) public {
        players[msg.sender].rank = _rank;
        distributeRewards(msg.sender);
    }

    function distributeRewards(address _player) private {
        if (_player == winner) {
            players[_player].gold += 10000;
            players[_player].mysteryBoxes += 5;
            players[_player].characterSkins += 1;
            if (!players[_player].hasEventExclusiveRing) {
                players[_player].hasEventExclusiveRing = true;
            }
            if (players[_player].crystalBoxes < 5) {
                players[_player].crystalBoxes += 5 - players[_player].crystalBoxes;
            }
        } else if (players[_player].rank <= 5) {
            players[_player].gold += 5000;
            players[_player].mysteryBoxes += 3;
            if (players[_player].crystalBoxes < 3) {
                players[_player].crystalBoxes += 3 - players[_player].crystalBoxes;
            }
        } else if (players[_player].rank <= 10) {
            players[_player].gold += 2500;
            players[_player].mysteryBoxes += 1;
            if (players[_player].crystalBoxes < 1) {
                players[_player].crystalBoxes += 1 - players[_player].crystalBoxes;
            }
        } else {
            players[_player].gold += 100;
        }
    }

    function setWinner(address _winner) public {
        winner = _winner;
        distributeRewards(winner);
    }

    function getPlayerRewards(address _player) public view returns (uint, uint, uint, bool, uint) {
        return (players[_player].gold, players[_player].mysteryBoxes, players[_player].characterSkins, players[_player].hasEventExclusiveRing, players[_player].crystalBoxes);
    }
}
```

In this contract, I've added a `hasEventExclusiveRing` field to the `Player` struct to keep track of whether the player has received the event exclusive ring. I've also added a `crystalBoxes` field to keep track of the number of mystery boxes containing crystals.

The `distributeRewards` function now checks if the player has received the event exclusive ring. If they haven't, it sets `hasEventExclusiveRing` to `true` and adds enough crystal boxes to reach 5.

The `getPlayerRewards` function now also returns the `hasEventExclusiveRing` and `crystalBoxes` fields.

Please note that this is a basic implementation and may need to be adapted to your specific needs.
